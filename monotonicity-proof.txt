Given:

pos(I, phi) is a subset of pos(I', phi)

To Prove:
if I |= phi, then I' |= phi

Definitions:
A. pos(I, phi) := the literals of phi satisfied by I
B. litCount(phi) := the total number of literals in phi
C. I |= phi is equivalent to the statement |pos(I, phi)| = litCount(phi)

Proof:
Direct proof

Given any formula phi, and interpretations I and I' such that pos(I, phi) is a subset of pos(I', phi),
Assume I |= phi

By definition C and the assumption above,
|pos(I, phi)| = litCount(phi)

pos(I, phi) is a subset of pos(I', phi), therefore |pos(I, phi)| is less than or equal to |pos(I', phi)|

Since |pos(I, phi)| = litCount(phi), litCount(phi) is less than or equal to |pos(I', phi)|

Since litCount(phi) is less than or equal to |pos(I', phi)|, |pos(I', phi)| >= litCount(phi)

Using Lemma A and that |pos(I', phi)| >= litCount(phi),
I' |= phi
QED
