Given:

pos(I, phi) is a subset of pos(I', phi)

To Prove:
if I |= phi, then I' |= phi

Definitions:

An NNF formula is one of:
	Literal
	NNF or NNF
	NNF and NNF
	
A Literal is a two-element pair:
	(notNegated, var)
	where negated is a Boolean representing whether the variable is or isn't negated (False means negated), and var is the variable name

An Interpretation is a set of Assignments to variables

An Assignment is a two-element tuple:
	(var, value)
	where var is the variable name, and value is either TRUE or FALSE

getLiterals phi :: NNF -> [Literal]
getLiterals (Literal negated var) = ((Literal negated var):[])
getLiterals (a or b) = (getLiterals a) ++ (getLiterals b)
getLiterals (a and b) = (getLiterals a) ++ (getLiterals b)

pos I phi :: Interpretation -> NNF -> [Literal]
pos I phi :: posHelper I (getLiterals phi)

posHelper :: Interpretation -> [Literal] -> [Literal]
posHelper [] _ = []
posHelper (a:I) literals =
	let l <- (Literal a.value a.var)
	if l in literals
		[l] ++ (posHelper I literals)
	else
		(posHelper I literals)

Lemma A:
If I |= phi, then (pos I phi) must return all literals in phi,
therefore the following statement holds
(length (pos I phi)) = (length (getLiterals phi))

Proof:
Direct proof

Given any NNF formula phi, and interpretations I and I' such that pos(I, phi) is a subset of pos(I', phi),
Assume I |= phi

By Lemma A and the assumption above,
(length (pos I phi)) = (length (getLiterals phi))

pos(I, phi) is a subset of pos(I', phi), therefore (length (pos I phi)) <= (length (pos I' phi)) 

Since (length (pos I phi)) = (length (getLiterals phi)), (length (getLiterals phi)) <= (length (pos I' phi))

Since an Interpretation cannot satisfy more literals than exist in the original NNF formula, (length (getLiterals phi)) = (length (pos I' phi))

By Lemma B, (length (getLiterals phi)) = (length (pos I' phi)) implies I' |= phi
