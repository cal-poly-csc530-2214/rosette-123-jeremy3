* Started by installing racket and setting up rosette. Setup was fairly smooth.
* Read through Rosette docs. Read through the functions Alex mentioned in class (sat?, unsat?, model, etc.). These were very helpful as I was a bit confused at first since I started by reading the solve function documentation.

* Worked on problem 1 of homework 1, in classify.rkt. Refreshed myself on Racket (hash tables, and unit tests). Wrote the classify function along with some unit tests.

* Started work on problem 2. Found out CNF means Conjunctive Normal Form. Read Wikipedia articles on CNF and Tseytin transformation.
